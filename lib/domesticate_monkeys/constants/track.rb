    # The Track class serves as the main class for tracking all method definitions:
    # each method, for each object, that gets defined during the initialization 
    # process, gets it's own track with a uniquely identifying key, such as:
    # 'Nokogiri.scrape', or: 'User#format_name'.

    # The Track instance keeps track of the amount of definitions, the chronological
    # sequence of the source of the definitions, and potentially other information
    # which we will deem valuable in the future.
